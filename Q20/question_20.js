// 20.Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var mountains = ["Mount Everest", "K2", "Rakaposhi", "Malam Jabba"];
console.log("List of Mountains:");
mountains.forEach(function (mountain) { return console.log(mountain); });
