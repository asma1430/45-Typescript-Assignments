Getting Started Exercises with TypeScript and Node.js
I have completed 45 assignments on TypeScript, covering various core concepts. 
These exercises range from simple TypeScript basics to more complex applications, providing a solid foundation in TypeScript and Node.js. 
The assignments include tasks like personal messages, manipulating strings, working with arrays, Conditional Statements, Functions, 
Objects and Interfaces, Loops and Iterations, Error Handling, Comments and Documentation, TypeScript Features and more.
