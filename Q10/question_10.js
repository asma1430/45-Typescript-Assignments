//10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
// Asma 
// 23-4-2024
// We declared a string variable quote_01 and assigning it string value "Stay Hungry! Stay Foolish!" and concated it with other string Steve Jobs once said and consoled it.
var quote_01 = "Stay Hungry! Stay Foolish!";
console.log("Steve Jobs once said, \"".concat(quote_01, "\""));
// Asma 
// 23-4-2024
//We initialized two string variables, quote_02 and author, assigned them string values, then logged a message concating the author's name and quote_02 variable.
var quote_02 = "Stay Hungry! Stay Foolish!";
var author = "Steve Jobs";
console.log("".concat(author, " once said, \"").concat(quote_02, "\""));
